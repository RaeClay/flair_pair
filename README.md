# flair_pair

A new Flutter project by Rachel Clayton, John Amick, and Jacob Goldstein. Flair Pair is designed to provide users' with food and alcohol pairing recommendations.

## Getting Started

Once the app is running, the user will be presented with the **Home** screen. In this view the user may choose to browse seasonal pairings in the carousel slider, view a tips slideshow about food and alcohol pairing, or choose to browse all available pairings in the app's repository.

## Pairing Search
At the bottom of the screen the app's navigation bar is visible. The three navigation options are 'Home', 'Search', and 'Favorites'. 
In the **Find Pairings** screen, the user may type in the search bar by a food or alcohol name to receive a list of pairing results. They may also toggle 'Vegan' and 'Gluten-free' filters if they would like to search for pairings friendly to those restrictions. The user may favorite a pairing result in this view by tapping the 'heart' icon. They may remove an item from favorites by tapping the icon again.
On tapping a pairing result, the user will be met with the **Pairing Detail Screen**. This view provides more details about the specific pairing interacted with. The user may tap the 'Back' button to return to their search.

## Using the Favorites Function
In the **Favorites** page, a list of pairings favorited by the user are viewable. On tapping a favorited pairing, the user will be presented with the **Pairing Detail Screen** corresponding with the tapped pairing. Tapping the 'Back' button will return the user to the **Favorites** page. The user may remove favorites from this screen by tapping the 'heart' icon of a pairing.
